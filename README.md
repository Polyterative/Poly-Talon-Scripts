# Poly-Talon-Scripts

My custom talon voice configs for Mac, Windows, and Linux. WIP. This is intended to work with wav2letter.

Apps:
- Chrome
- Intellij (with custom keymaps)

Notes:

- commands are subject to change.

## Linux & Mac setup

Clone repo into `~/.talon/user`

```insert code:
cd ~/.talon/user
git clone https://github.com/Polyterative/Poly-Talon-Scripts/
```

Alternatively, access the directory by right clicking the Talon icon in taskbar, clicking Scripting>Open ~/talon, and navigating to user.
